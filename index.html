<h2>Meal planning with Max Flex</h2>
<p>If you're like most of us, you probably don't eat all the groceries you buy. </p>

<p>You may have tried meal planning in the past. On Sunday, you set out with great plans: you know what you're going to eat each night of the week. But by Thursday, you find that somebody has eaten all the carrots, you're out of milk, the leftovers from last Wednesday are still at the back of the fridge, and your grand plans are wrecked.</p>

</td> <td valign="top"><h3>Enter UseThis! </h3>
	<h3>A meal planning strategy with a difference.</h3>
<p>You don't need to think ahead six days, you need to know what you're having this evening... and possibly tomorrow. </p>
<p> Instead of planning out the whole week in advance, UseThis! tracks the current contents of your fridge and makes suggestions based on them.</p>
